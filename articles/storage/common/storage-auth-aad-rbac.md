# Manage access rights to Azure Storage data with RBAC (Preview)

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authorizes access rights to secured resources through [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview). Azure Storage defines a set of built-in RBAC roles that encompass common sets of permissions used to access containers or queues. When an RBAC role is assigned to an Azure AD identity, that identity is granted access to those resources, according to the specified scope. Access can be scoped to the level of the subscription, the resource group, the storage account, or an individual container or queue. You can assign access rights for Azure Storage resources using the Azure portal, Azure command-line tools, and Azure Management APIs. 

An Azure AD identity may be a user, group, or application service principal, or it may be a *managed service identity*. A security principal can be a user, group, or application service principal. A [managed service identity](../../active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview.md) is an automatically managed identity used to authenticate from applications running in Azure virtual machines, function apps, virtual machine scale sets, and others. For an overview of identity in Azure AD, see [Understand Azure identity solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/understand-azure-identity-solutions).

## RBAC roles for Azure Storage

Azure Storage supports both built-in and custom RBAC roles. Azure Storage offers these built-in RBAC roles for use with Azure AD:

- [Storage Blob Data Contributor (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor-preview)
- [Storage Blob Data Reader (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader-preview)
- [Storage Queue Data Contributor (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor-preview)
- [Storage Queue Data Reader (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-reader-preview)

For more information about how built-in roles are defined for Azure Storage, see [Understand role definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions#management-and-data-operations-preview).

You can also define custom roles for use with containers and queues. For more information, see [Create custom roles for Azure Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This preview is intended for non-production use only. Production service-level agreements (SLAs) will not be available until Azure AD integration for Azure Storage is declared generally available. If Azure AD integration is not yet supported for your scenario, continue to use Shared Key authorization or SAS tokens in your applications. For additional information about the preview, see [Authenticate access to Azure Storage using Azure Active Directory (Preview)](storage-auth-aad.md).
>
> During the preview, RBAC role assignments may take up to five minutes to propagate.

## Assign a role to a security principal

Assign an RBAC role to an Azure identity to grant permissions to containers or queues in your storage account. You can scope the role assignment to the storage account, or to a specific container or queue. The following table summarizes the access rights granted by the built-in roles, depending on scope: 

|                                 |     Blob Data Contributor                                                 |     Blob Data Reader                                                |     Queue Data Contributor                                  |     Queue Data Reader                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|    Scoped to subscription       |    Read/write access to all containers and blobs in the subscription       |    Read access to all containers and blobs in the subscription       |    Read/write access to all queues in the subscription       |    Read access to all queues in the subscription         |
|    Scoped to resource group     |    Read/write access to all containers and blobs in the resource group     |    Read access to all containers and blobs in the resource group     |    Read/write access to all queues in the resource group     |    Read access to all queues in the resource group     |
|    Scoped to storage account    |    Read/write access to all containers and blobs in the storage account    |    Read access to all containers and blobs in the storage account    |    Read/write access to all queues in the storage account    |    Read access to all queues in the storage account    |
|    Scoped to container/queue    |    Read/write access to the specified container and its blobs              |    Read access to the specified container and its blobs              |    Read/write access to the specified queue                  |    Read access to the specified queue                    |

> [!NOTE]
> As an owner of your Azure Storage account, you are not automatically assigned permissions to access data. You must explicitly assign yourself an RBAC role for Azure Storage. You can assign it at the level of your subscription, resource group, storage account, or a container or queue.

For details on the permissions required to call Azure Storage operations, see [Permissions for calling REST operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/authenticate-with-azure-active-directory#permissions-for-calling-rest-operations).

The following sections show how to assign a role scoped to the storage account or scoped to an individual container.

### Assign a role scoped to the storage account in the Azure portal

To assign a built-in role granting access to all containers or queues in the storage account in the Azure portal:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your storage account.
2. Select your storage account, then select **Access Control (IAM)** to display access control settings for the account. Click the **Add** button to add a new role.

    ![Screen shot showing storage access control settings](media/storage-auth-aad-rbac/portal-access-control.png)

3. In the **Add permissions** window, select the role to assign to an Azure AD identity. Then search to locate the identity to whom you want to assign that role. For example, the following image shows the **Storage Blob Data Reader (Preview)** role assigned to a user.

    ![Screen shot showing how to assign an RBAC role](media/storage-auth-aad-rbac/add-rbac-role.png)

4. Click **Save**. The identity to whom you assigned the role appears listed under that role. For example, the following image shows that the users added now have read permissions to all blob data in the storage account.

### Assign a role scoped to a container or queue in the Azure portal

The steps for assigning a built-in role scoped to a container or to a queue are similar. The procedure shown here assigns a role scoped to a container, but you can follow the same steps to assign a role scoped to a queue: 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your storage account and display the **Overview** for the account.
2. Under Blob Service, select **Browse Blobs**. 
3. Locate the container for which you want to assign a role, and display the container's settings. 
4. Select **Access Control (IAM)** to display access control settings for the container.
5. In the **Add permissions** window, select the role that you want to assign to an Azure AD identity. Then search to locate the identity to which you want to assign that role.
6. Click **Save**. The identity to whom you assigned the role appears listed under that role. For example, the following image shows that the user added now has read permissions to data in the container named *sample-container*.
